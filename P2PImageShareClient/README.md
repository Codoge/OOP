#P2P Image Share System

a peer- to-peer (P2P) images sharing system. A hybrid P2P structure is used in this project, where a server is used as the source of images as well as that of the list of peers available.

How to run it:
First, run ImageServer.java up, choose image to share.
Then, run ImagePeer.java up, type in username & password(both of them are "admin"), type in server ip.

When run it up, it like the pic below:
